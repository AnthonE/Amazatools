Helpful gamedev network utilities- Float compressor

Current just a Float compressor. C# and the main script is Unity free. Only the test script to show a visual representation requires Unity.
The float compressor takes a min, max, and accuracy float then stores the compressed number along with the total bits into a readonly struct.
Very handy if you're packing bits for a networking game.  

Special Thanks! - Fholm, FSE_Vincenzo, and Mirror team along with the amazing discord server.
