Helpful gamedev network utilites

Current just a Float compressor. C# and the main script is Unity free. Only the test script to show a visual representation requires Unity.
The float compressor takes a min, max, and accuracy float then and stores the compressed numeber along with total bit into a readonly struct.
Very handy if your packing bits for a networking game.
